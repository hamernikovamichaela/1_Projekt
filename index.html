          Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered
          all over this planet; you just need to know where to find them. We do.
          Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out
          there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We're proud of our
          record of successful ascents (over 92% of our travelers make it to the
          top of Kili, depending on the route), but it's our CEOs and local
          guides that make the journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if
          you're not into big climbs, don't sweat it; we've got loads of
          lower-impact walks and iconic treks you'll love, too.
